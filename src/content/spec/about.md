# About

Welcome to my personal blog!

I go by the name Maxin, a fusion of `min` from my given name and `max`. Originally hailing from [Anhui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anhui), I spent my formative years in the vibrant city of [Shanghai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai). My academic journey led me through esteemed institutions; I earned both my bachelor's and master's degrees in Electrical Engineering from [Harbin Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbin_Institute_of_Technology), [KU Leuven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KU_Leuven), and [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KTH_Royal_Institute_of_Technology). Currently, I am immersed in the world of software engineering at Texas Instruments in Norway.

Beyond the realm of work, my passions encompass a diverse array of interests. I find solace and joy in gaming across platforms such as PC, PS5, and Switch. I indulge in literary adventures, traversing genres like science fiction and suspense novels. Cinematic narratives captivate me, as does the art of photography, which I'm exploring at a beginner level.

This blog serves as a conduit for various purposes:

- Sharing insights and notes gleaned from continual learning, a cornerstone of my journey as a programmer.
- Reflecting on technical intricacies and the tapestry of life.
- Showcasing glimpses captured through my lens, inviting you into my world visually.
