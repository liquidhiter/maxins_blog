## Chapter 1: Introduction

- rules can be followed unconsciously, they are not always that **obvious**

  - software development or testing phase
- troubleshooting
  - production or post-deployment phase

## Chapter 2: The Rules-Suitable for Framing

- [ ] skip

## Chapter 3: Understand the System

- **a working knowledge of what the system is supposed to do**
  - first step to understand the problem itself
- Read the manual
  - internal manual / functional specification / study the code / read the comments
    - TO understand the expected behavior 
      - ALSO the first step toward not breaking the system
  - **IMPORTANT**
    - DON'T necessarily trust this information as they can be wrong!!!
- Read Everything Cover to Cover
  - be suspicious about every possibilities
- Know What's Reasonable
  - basic background knowledge of the technical fields
- Know the Road Map
  - initial guesses about where to divide a system **in order to isolate the problem** ...
    - top-level overview of the system - what all the blocks do and all the interfaces do
      - <u>*there is no need to understand all the blocks, but knowing how they are supposed to interact with other parts allows to at least locate the problem as being inside the box or outside the box*</u>
- Know Your Tools
- Look It Up
  - Don't guess! Look up details.
